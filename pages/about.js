            <h1>Hello.</h1>
            <p>My name is Gareth Carter and I am a web developer based in the UK.</p>
            <p></p>

            <p>After a not-so brief stint in the world of libraries and archives, I decided to   </p>
            {/* <p>My name is Joost van der Schee and I am a web developer based in Amsterdam. This harsh looking website is actually a tribute to the web.</p> */}
            <p>I have studied Industrial Design Engineering at the Technical University in Delft and founded ‘Usecue’ in 2007. My first priority is my family, but my work is absolutely number two. I love what I do, which is building beautiful websites and web applications.</p>
            <p>All websites I build are well-coded and have good SEO. This is reflected by their excellent Google score, an objective quality measurement of a website. Quality is very important to me. I strongly believe that each job worth doing is worth doing well. Therefore I do not just build these websites, but host them as well. This supply chain integration is the reason I can deliver such high quality.</p>
            <p>I am a big fan of Jekyll (a website generator). To help fellow Jekyll-enthusiasts, I have launched jekyllcodex.org and I answer Jekyll-related questions on Stack Overflow. CloudCannon (an online CMS for Jekyll) mentioned me as a Jekyll expert on their ‘experts page’. I was also one of the speakers on JekyllConf 2019.</p>
            <p>Apart from Jekyll/CloudCannon websites I also develop WordPress, Issuu, MailChimp, Shopify and custom web solutions. My latest projects include open source invoicing software, called ‘Invoice Lion’, a progressive web app (PWA) for my company and a platform for producing online magazines, called ‘Online Magazine Maker’.</p>
